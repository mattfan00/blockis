# blockis

**blockis** is a online Tetris clone where players can compete in battle-royale Tetris games. Players can quickly hop into any game room to start playing immediately or create their own game room and invite all of their friends. **blockis** is inspired by Tetris Battles and [Jstris](https://jstris.jezevec10.com/). 

**blockis** uses HTML5 canvas and Javascript to run the game in the browser, Node.js and MongoDB to handle the backend, and socket.io to handle the real-time communication between players in the same game room.
